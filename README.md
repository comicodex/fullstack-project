## Fullstack Project

### Introduction
This is a collaborative team project to put together and deploy a flask application with image classifier models. We started off with a given database of animal images (ants and bees) and build a classifier to properly classify them. We then proceeded to create a small database of random images and built and trained a second model with very good accuracy results. This project was carried out by implementing both front-end development and back-end development skills. For its deployment we used the Flask application.
